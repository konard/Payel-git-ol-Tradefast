# TRADEFΛST

> A disciplined crypto market-research CLI — strategies, analytics, risk and
> AI-assisted research — in the style of the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).

TRADEFΛST fetches OHLCV candles, runs **13 trading strategies** over them,
sizes positions with volatility-aware risk management, indexes a knowledge base,
optionally scrapes references and crawls market news with Playwright, and
narrates the result through a pluggable AI advisor — all from a polished
interactive terminal UI.

## Highlights

- **51 research sources** across 6 groups: economic calendars, news portals,
  crypto news portals (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, The Block, Decrypt, …), Reddit
  communities (10 subreddits with comment traversal), crypto communities
  (r/Bitcoin, r/ethereum, r/CryptoMarkets, …), and exchange communities
  (Binance, Bybit, OKX, MEXC blogs + subreddits).
- **Configurable research depth**: `/serching-level` sets crawl aggressiveness from
  Normal (fast) to Max (full comment graph), persisted across sessions.
- **Selectable research platforms**: `/serching-platforms` lets you toggle source
  groups on/off — skip Reddit, use only calendars, or go all-in.
- **Reddit-specific extraction**: specialized parser follows comment-thread links
  to other Reddit posts and external articles.
- **13 strategies** computed from textbook technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI,
  ATR, Bollinger, MACD, Stochastic, VWAP, Donchian, OLS slope).
- **Exact money math** — every value that touches money or position sizing runs
  through a 64-digit [Math.js](https://mathjs.org) `BigNumber` instance, so
  `0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3` exactly and quantities are reproducible.
- **Drizzle ORM** on PostgreSQL — runs on an **embedded PGlite** database with
  zero configuration, or on a real PostgreSQL server via `DATABASE_URL`.
- **Interactive command set with precise lifecycle rules**: `/start`, `/update`,
  `/backtest`, `/news`, `/clear`, `/clear-chat`, `/status`, `/strategies`, `/theme`,
  `/exchange`, `/currency`, `/operating-mode`, `/operating-mode-time`,
  `/serching-level`, `/serching-platforms`, `/ratings`, `/api`, `/help`, `/exit`.
- **Source credibility ratings**: `/ratings` shows all 51 sources ranked by
  credibility score. Adjust ratings with `/ratings correct` / `incorrect` /
  `loud-claim` or a numeric grade (`/ratings "Хабр" -1`). AI can modify ratings
  via the `run_ratings_adjust` tool on user feedback.
- **Selectable operating modes**: `/operating-mode` opens a pop-up to switch the
  trading style between **long-term**, **medium-term** and **scalping**, so the
  platform is no longer locked to a single horizon.
- **Walk-forward backtester**: `/backtest` replays history with the *same*
  forecast logic the Trade Log shows and reports win rate, expectancy and profit
  factor — so the forecasts can be validated against real price action instead of
  trusted blindly.
- **News crawler**: Playwright-backed source collection driven by
  `src/config/news-sources.json`, with per-source limits and resilient failures.
- **AI correction layer**: after analysis, a single API call validates and
  corrects TP/SL/direction for all symbols at once, with market-driven
  explanations shown in the Trade Log's AI column.
- **Five pillars**: market math, analytics, search, scraping/news crawling
  (Playwright) and an AI advisor — each behind a small interface,
  dependency-injected and testable.
- **Works offline or live**: deterministic synthetic market data keeps CI and
  demos reproducible; Binance, CoinGecko and MEXC adapters can pull real crypto
  market rates, and a Frankfurter (ECB) adapter pulls live forex rates for the
  Pocket Option binary-options venue.
- **Spot and binary options**: crypto exchanges bracket trades with a
  take-profit and stop-loss; Pocket Option, a forex binary-options venue, has no
  TP/SL — so its forecasts replace those levels with an **expiry time** (how long
  to hold the directional bet) while every strategy algorithm stays identical.
- **In-process NestJS GraphQL backend**: the interactive CLI starts a local
  GraphQL endpoint without a second service process.
- **Repository-mediated GraphQL layer**: the API surface lives entirely in the
  backend. Both ends of the `cli → graphql → backend` path own a repository — the
  backend `TradefastRepository` (`src/backend/graphql/`) maps the application
  facade onto GraphQL DTOs, and the frontend `GraphqlTradefastRepository`
  (`src/cli/graphql/`) is the only place the CLI talks to the API. Each GraphQL
  class lives in its own file on both sides. The headless `status`, `strategies`
  and `clear` commands make their requests through this path.
- **Dockerised**: `docker compose up` brings up PostgreSQL and the CLI.

## Quick start

Requires **Node.js ≥ 20**.

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run dev          # launch the interactive CLI (tsx, no build needed)
```

Inside the shell, type a command:

```
> /start
```

### One-shot / scripted runs

Every command also works non-interactively, printing plain text (ideal for CI,
cron or Docker):

```bash
npm run build                 # bundle to dist/index.js
node dist/index.js start      # run a full analysis and exit
node dist/index.js backtest   # replay history and print forecast accuracy
node dist/index.js status     # print table counts + latest analytics
node dist/index.js strategies # list strategies
node dist/index.js news       # crawl configured market news sources
```

Want a fully deterministic, offline run? Use the synthetic market source:

```bash
TRADEFAST_MARKET_SOURCE=synthetic TRADEFAST_DATA_DIR=:memory: node dist/index.js start
```

## Commands

| Command        | What it does                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/start`       | Run a full analysis. **Clears prior run data first**, then collects afresh. The general search table is **never** wiped. |
| `/update`      | Re-analyse and persist **only what changed** (diff-aware upserts).           |
| `/backtest`    | Replay history and report how often each forecast's take-profit was reached **before** its stop-loss (win rate, expectancy, profit factor). |
| `/news`        | Crawl configured market news and economic-calendar sources into `news_items`. |
| `/clear`       | Prune outdated runs, keeping the latest run and the general search table.    |
| `/status`      | Show per-table row counts and the latest run's analytics.                    |
| `/strategies`  | List every available strategy.                                               |
| `/theme [name]`| Open the selector window, or switch directly by name (`violet`, `ocean`, `ember`, `forest`, `mono`). |
| `/operating-mode [name]` | Open the trading-style selector pop-up, or switch directly by name (`long-term`, `medium-term`, `scalping`). Applies that horizon's timeframe. |
| `/operating-mode-time [tf]` | Open the timeframe selector, or set it directly (`1m`–`1d`) to fine-tune within the current mode. |
| `/serching-level [level]` | Set crawl depth/resolution: `normal` (fast, depth 2), `high` (deep, depth 4), or `max` (full graph, depth 8 with comment traversal). Opens a pop-up without argument. |
| `/serching-platforms` | Toggle source groups on/off: economic calendars, news portals, crypto news, Reddit communities, crypto communities, exchange communities. Opens a multi-select pop-up. |
| `/currency [symbol]` | Run a full forecast for a single symbol with news sentiment and price chart. |
| `/exchange [name]` | Switch the venue/data source: `binance`, `okx`, `bybit`, `mexc` (crypto spot) or `pocketoption` (forex binary options). Pocket Option swaps in forex majors and renders an expiry **Time** column instead of TP/SL. Opens a pop-up without an argument. |
| `/ratings` | Show source credibility ratings. Subcommands: `correct`, `incorrect`, `loud-claim`, or a numeric grade (`/ratings "Хабр" -1`). |
| `/clear-chat` | Clear the chat transcript and reset AI conversation history, restoring the welcome banner and tips. |
| `/api`         | Show the in-process GraphQL endpoint.                                        |
| `/help`        | Show the command list.                                                       |
| `/exit`        | Quit (aliases: `/quit`, `/q`, `Esc`, `Ctrl+C`).                              |

The leading slash is optional. The "general search results" table
(`search_results`) is the one table that **survives `/start` and `/clear`** — it
accumulates discoveries across every session, exactly as required.
Collected `news_items` also survive these lifecycle commands so news history can
feed a future market-assessment model.

While typing a command, Tradefast shows matching command suggestions. Press
`Tab` to complete an unambiguous command prefix. Run `/theme` to open the theme
selector window, or pass a theme name for one-shot switching.

### Operating modes

Tradefast is no longer locked to a single trading horizon. Run `/operating-mode`
to open a pop-up and pick a trading style — **long-term**, **medium-term** or
**scalping** — and the analysis timeframe shifts to match (daily, hourly or 5m
candles, respectively). On first launch the pop-up opens automatically so you
choose a style before starting; your choice is remembered across sessions. Use
`/operating-mode-time` afterwards to fine-tune the exact timeframe within a mode.

## Strategies

All strategies share the same `Strategy` interface (`id`, `title`, `minCandles`,
`evaluate`) and are pure and stateless — the same candles always yield the same
signal.

| Id                    | Strategy                       | Core idea                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `trend-following`     | Trend Following                | Price above SMA20 & SMA50 with positive OLS slope    |
| `mean-reversion`      | Mean Reversion (Bollinger)     | Fade Bollinger-band extremes back to the mean        |
| `breakout`            | Breakout                       | Enter as price clears a recent range high/low        |
| `scalping-momentum`   | Scalping Momentum (RSI)        | Short-term RSI thrust with momentum confirmation     |
| `smart-money`         | Smart Money Concept (BOS)      | Break-of-structure / liquidity shifts                |
| `support-resistance`  | Support & Resistance           | Reactions at clustered supply/demand levels          |
| `pullback`            | Pullback                       | Buy dips / sell rallies within a trend               |
| `macd-momentum`       | MACD Momentum                  | Signal-line crossovers and histogram expansion       |
| `donchian-breakout`   | Donchian Breakout (Turtle)     | Classic channel breakout                             |
| `bollinger-squeeze`   | Bollinger Squeeze              | Low-volatility contraction preceding expansion       |
| `stochastic-reversal` | Stochastic Reversal            | %K/%D crosses in overbought/oversold zones           |
| `vwap-reversion`      | VWAP Reversion                 | Reversion toward intraday fair value                 |
| `grid`                | Grid (Range)                   | Harvest oscillation in sideways regimes              |

The `StrategyEngine` runs them all, aggregates a strength-weighted **consensus
score** in `[-1, 1]`, and exposes the strongest signal. A failing strategy
degrades to a neutral signal rather than taking the whole run down.

### Calculation accuracy

- **Indicators** operate on native `number` arrays (the standard for technical
  analysis) but borrow `mean`/`std` from Math.js so the formulas are exactly the
  textbook ones. RSI and ATR use Wilder smoothing; Bollinger uses the population
  standard deviation; EMA is seeded with the SMA of the first window to avoid
  first-price drift. Every series returns the same length as its input, padded
  with `NaN` for "not enough data yet".
- **Money & position sizing** run through a dedicated 64-digit Math.js
  `BigNumber` instance (`src/strategies/mathx.ts`). Position size is
  `quantity = (equity × risk%) / stopDistance`, with an ATR-based stop fallback
  and a 2 % hard-stop fallback. These paths are covered by exactness tests.

---

## Backtesting forecast accuracy

A forecast is only as trustworthy as its track record, so `/backtest` measures
that record directly. It is a **walk-forward** simulation: for every evaluable
bar it rebuilds the exact forecast a user would have seen at that moment
(`buildForecast` over the candles known *up to that point*), then replays the
*future* bars to decide whether the take-profit or the stop-loss was hit first.

The forecast logic is shared with the Trade Log through a single source of truth
(`src/strategies/forecast.ts`), so the metrics describe the live system — not a
different model fit to history. The simulation is deliberately conservative:

- **No look-ahead.** A forecast made on the close of bar `i` is resolved only
  against bars `> i`.
- **Non-overlapping trades.** The next entry is considered only after the
  previous trade closes.
- **Stop-first tie-break.** When a single bar straddles both levels, the stop is
  assumed to fill first, so the reported edge is never flattering.

Each trade is scored in **R-multiples** (multiples of the risked stop distance):
a take-profit at the 2:1 target earns `+2R`, a stop costs `−1R`. The report rolls
these up per symbol and across the portfolio:

```bash
node dist/index.js backtest
```

```
Backtest — forecast accuracy (TP before SL)
╭──────────┬────────┬───────┬─────────┬───────────────╮
│ Currency │ Trades │ Win % │ Exp (R) │ Profit factor │
├──────────┼────────┼───────┼─────────┼───────────────┤
│ SOLUSDT  │ 12     │ 41.7% │ +0.18   │ 1.31          │
│ ETHUSDT  │ 9      │ 33.3% │ -0.05   │ 0.92          │
├──────────┼────────┼───────┼─────────┼───────────────┤
│ TOTAL    │ 21     │ 38.1% │ +0.08   │ 1.13          │
╰──────────┴────────┴───────┴─────────┴───────────────╯
```

- **Win %** — winning trades / decided trades (TP or SL; timeouts excluded).
- **Exp (R)** — mean R per trade, the system's expectancy. Positive is an edge.
- **Profit factor** — gross winning R / gross losing R; `> 1` is profitable,
  `∞` when nothing lost.

Use it before trading a symbol: a negative expectancy or a profit factor below 1
means the forecasts have *not* held up on that instrument's recent history.

On a binary-options venue (Pocket Option) the same walk-forward harness settles
each trade differently: there is no TP/SL to hit, so a position is held for its
**expiry** (`EXPIRY_BARS` bars of the analysed timeframe) and then scored purely
on direction — a win if price closed beyond the entry the predicted way. Wins
pay the configured binary payout (~0.92R) and losses cost the full stake (−1R),
so the same Win % / expectancy / profit-factor rollup still applies.

## Configuration

All configuration is environment-driven (see `.env.example`):

| Variable                  | Default                       | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`            | _(unset → PGlite)_            | PostgreSQL connection string. Unset uses embedded PGlite.      |
| `TRADEFAST_DATA_DIR`       | `.tradefast/pgdata`            | PGlite data directory (`:memory:` for ephemeral).              |

| `TRADEFAST_INTERVAL`       | `1h`                          | Candle interval.                                               |
| `TRADEFAST_MODE`           | `medium-term`                 | Initial operating mode (`long-term`, `medium-term`, `scalping`). |
| `TRADEFAST_CANDLE_LIMIT`   | `200`                         | Number of candles to fetch per symbol.                         |
| `TRADEFAST_ACCOUNT_BALANCE`| `10000`                       | Account equity used for position sizing.                       |
| `TRADEFAST_THEME`          | `violet`                      | Initial CLI theme.                                             |
| `TRADEFAST_API`            | `1`                           | Start the in-process GraphQL API with the interactive CLI.      |
| `TRADEFAST_API_HOST`       | `127.0.0.1`                   | GraphQL bind host.                                             |
| `TRADEFAST_API_PORT`       | `0`                           | GraphQL bind port (`0` selects a free port).                    |
| `TRADEFAST_SCRAPE`         | `0`                           | Set to `1` to enable the Playwright scraping pillar.           |
| `TRADEFAST_NEWS_SOURCES_FILE` | `src/config/news-sources.json` | Optional custom JSON source list for `/news`.                |
| `TRADEFAST_NEWS_LIMIT`     | `8`                           | Default max accepted items per source during `/news`.          |
| `TRADEFAST_NEWS_DEPTH`     | `2`                           | Link depth for source-local event/article crawling.            |
| `TRADEFAST_NEWS_PAGE_LIMIT`| `8`                           | Maximum pages to visit per configured news source.             |
| `TRADEFAST_NEWS_LINKS_PER_PAGE` | `6`                      | Maximum follow-up links queued from one crawled page.          |
| `TRADEFAST_AI_API_URL`     | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint for AI corrections.               |
| `TRADEFAST_AI_API_KEY`     | _(unset → heuristic)_        | API key (falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).                    |
| `TRADEFAST_AI_MODEL`       | `claude-4.7-opus`             | Model for per-symbol advice and cross-symbol correction.        |
| `TRADEFAST_SKIP_AI_VALIDATION` | `0`                        | Set to `1` to skip the cross-symbol AI correction step.        |
| `TRADEFAST_SEARCHING_LEVEL`| _(unset → pop-up)_           | Preset depth: `normal`, `high`, or `max`. Skips the pop-up.     |
| `TRADEFAST_SEARCHING_PLATFORMS` | _(unset → pop-up)_      | Comma-separated source groups to enable (e.g. `news-portals,reddit-communities`). Skips the pop-up. |

The market source falls back gracefully: `resilient` uses live Binance data and
transparently switches to deterministic synthetic candles if the network is
unreachable. `coingecko` uses `/api/v3/simple/price`; `mexc` uses
`/api/v3/ticker/price` and shapes the fetched spot rate into a candle series for
the strategy engine. `pocketoption` pulls the live forex rate from Frankfurter
(`/v2/rate/EUR/USD` → `{ "rates": { "USD": 1.15186 } }`) and shapes that single
ECB reference quote into the same candle series, so the unchanged strategy
algorithms run on forex pairs. Selecting Pocket Option via `/exchange` (or
`TRADEFAST_EXCHANGE=pocketoption`) automatically switches the default symbol
universe to forex majors (`EURUSD`, `GBPUSD`, `USDJPY`, …).

---

## Scraping (Playwright)

The scraping pillar is **opt-in** so `/start` stays fast and fully offline by
default. Enable it with:

```bash
TRADEFAST_SCRAPE=1 node dist/index.js start
```

When enabled, it scrapes the top reference for each symbol into the `scrapes`
table using headless Chromium. Chromium is loaded lazily and the scraper
degrades gracefully (recording a marked, empty result) if the binary is missing
or a page fails to load, so a run never aborts on a flaky network. Install the
browser with:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## News Crawler

The `/news` command crawls **51 market/economic sources** listed in
`src/config/news-sources.json` and upserts normalized items into `news_items`.
Each source has an id, title, kind, URL, enabled flag and optional per-source
limit. Sources are grouped into 6 platform groups:

| Group                  | Sources                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `economic-calendars`   | Investing, TradingView, Alfa-Forex, Forex Club, Forex Factory, DailyFX, Myfxbook — economic calendars. |
| `news-portals`         | TradingView, Investing, RBC, Kommersant, Mail.ru, LiteFinance, Euronews, CNBC, Reuters, MarketWatch, Yahoo Finance — market/economics news. |
| `crypto-news`          | CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, The Block, Decrypt, CryptoSlate, Bitcoin Magazine, CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap — crypto-native news. |
| `reddit-communities`   | 10 finance/market subreddits (economy, Finance, stocks, investing, wallstreetbets, StockMarket, Forex, CryptoCurrency, econ, FinancialNews) — kind: `reddit`. |
| `crypto-communities`   | 6 crypto subreddits (Bitcoin, ethereum, CryptoMarkets, defi, Altcoin, CryptoTechnology) — kind: `reddit`. |
| `exchange-communities` | Binance, Bybit, OKX, MEXC blogs + their subreddits.                     |

Sources with `kind: "reddit"` use a specialized extractor that reads Reddit
threads, extracts the self-text/comments, and follows comment-thread links to
other Reddit posts and external articles. This produces rich cross-referenced
discoveries from community discussions.

Use `/serching-platforms` to toggle entire groups on/off without editing the
JSON file. Disabled groups are skipped during the crawl.

Run it from the interactive shell or in one-shot mode:

```bash
node dist/index.js news
```

The crawler uses a lazy headless Chromium instance (or plain HTTP fallback when
the Chromium binary has not been downloaded, e.g. `npx playwright install` was
never run, or when launching the browser fails), scrolls each source page, extracts likely
article/event links, then follows source-local event and article URLs within the
configured depth/page budget. Detail pages are captured from their own
heading/metadata/body text, URLs are normalized, and items are deduplicated by
source and title. A failing source is recorded in the crawl report but does not
stop the remaining sources; a failing child page is skipped.

## Source Ratings

Every research source tracked by the system has a credibility score between
**0%** (untrusted) and **100%** (highly credible), starting at 100% by default.

View ratings with:

```bash
/ratings
```

Output shows sources grouped by kind with colour-coded scores. Adjust ratings
interactively:

| Subcommand | Example | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `correct <id>` | `/ratings correct investing-com` | +5% for a correct prediction |
| `incorrect <id>` | `/ratings incorrect investing-com` | −10% for an incorrect prediction |
| `loud-claim <id>` | `/ratings loud-claim investing-com` | −20% for a loud unsubstantiated claim |
| `<grade>` | `/ratings "Хабр" -1` | Adjust by ±N% points (grade/100) |

The AI assistant can also adjust ratings automatically via the
`run_ratings_adjust(source, grade)` tool when you give feedback like
*"Хабр плохой источник"* or *"понизь Хабр на 2"*.

Scores are persisted in the `source_ratings` table and survive all lifecycle
commands (`/start`, `/clear`). Sources inactive for >30 days decay by 5%.

## AI advisor

By default a deterministic local **heuristic advisor** narrates the analytics.
When `TRADEFAST_AI_API_KEY` (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) is set, the system uses it
in two places:

1. **Per-symbol advice** — `LlmAdvisor` sends each symbol's analytics to the
   configured model (`TRADEFAST_AI_MODEL`, default `claude-4.7-opus`) and stores
   the summary. Falls back to heuristic on error.
2. **Cross-symbol correction** — after all symbols are analysed, a single request
   sends all symbol data + news consensus to the AI. The AI returns a
   `CorrectedForecast[]` with `correctedTp`/`correctedSl`/`correctedDirection`
   and a `reason` field: a market-driven explanation (news, macro, context) of
   **why** the price will move in that direction. These reasons appear in the
   **AI column** of the Trade Log table.

The API supports both OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`) and
the native Anthropic Messages API — detected automatically from the URL. On any
failure the system degrades gracefully without interrupting the run.

### AI chat tools

When the AI advisor mode is active and uses a chat-capable model, the system
exposes these tools to the AI:

- **`run_serching_level`** — sets crawl depth/resolution. The AI can request
  `normal` (fast, shallow), `high` (deep), or `max` (exhaustive) depending on
  how much context it needs.
- **`run_serching_platforms`** — enables/disables source groups. The AI can
  toggle specific groups (e.g. enable only `economic-calendars` for
  fundamentals) to tailor research scope.
- **`run_ratings_adjust`** — modifies a source's credibility rating. Parameters:
  `source` (title or ID) and `grade` (integer, e.g. `-1` = −1%). Triggered by
  user feedback like *"Хабр -1"* or *"понизь рейтинг Хабру"*.

These tools are defined in `src/services/chat.ts` and are automatically
registered when the chat service initializes.

## Docker

Bring up PostgreSQL and the CLI with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d db                 # start PostgreSQL
docker compose run --rm Tradefast        # open the interactive CLI
docker compose run --rm Tradefast start  # one-shot collection
```

The CLI service connects to the bundled Postgres via `DATABASE_URL` and applies
migrations automatically. To bake the Chromium binary into the image for
scraping, build with `--build-arg INSTALL_CHROMIUM=1` (also configurable in
`docker-compose.yml`).

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test          # run the full vitest suite
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
```

The suite covers indicator/math accuracy, position sizing and `Money` exactness,
strategy behaviour on crafted trend/range data, the forecast brackets and the
walk-forward backtester (R-multiple math, the stop-first tie-break and the
no-look-ahead guarantee), the store's lifecycle rules (`/start` wipe, `/update`
diff, `/clear` prune) against an in-memory PGlite database, and the full
collection pipeline end to end with offline doubles.
